# crysknife<br/>
This project is a proof of concept for Dependency injection framework CDI (LIKE??) with a support of popular features. At this point it supports @Singleton and @Dependent scopes, fields and constractor injections, @PostContract calls, transitive injections, @Named qualifiers and @Produces for custom objects like elemental2 widgets and GWT.create if needed. Itâ€™s based on annotation processors generation and have no gwt 2.8 dependencies. Demo shows usage of a simple page compiled with j2cl (with j2clmavenplugin by @gitgabrio).


Please, remember that it's a POC, nothing more at this moment.</br>
Feel free to comment and criticize.
